# Series

Adds a new taxonomy called "series" to your blog that allows you to link together several posts in a series.

Series is a plugin created to allow users to easily link posts together by using a WordPress taxonomy (like tags or categories) called "series".  It can be particularly useful if you write several posts spanning the same topic and want them tied together in some way that tags or categories doesn't cover.
